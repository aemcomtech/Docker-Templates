# 🏠 Sovereignty in the Stack: Breaking the Subscription Cycle

> "We used to buy software; now we just rent it. It’s time to reclaim our digital assets."

Welcome to the **aemcomtech.au** repository. This space is dedicated to the pursuit of **Digital Sovereignty**—the radical idea that you should own the platforms you rely on. In an era where "Software as a Service" (SaaS) has become "Software as a Subscription," this project provides the blueprints to host your own alternatives.

### 🎩 The MadHatter Summary
* **The Architect (White Hat):** A structural shift from centralized cloud dependency to decentralized local resilience.
* **The Economist (Green Hat):** Why pay $15/month for a media suite or $10/month for automation when you can run it on your own silicon for the cost of electricity?
* **The Scholar (Blue Hat):** A practical masterclass in Docker orchestration, networking, and the philosophy of data ownership.
* **The Guardian (Red Hat):** Protecting your privacy by ensuring your data never leaves your network unless you authorize it.

### 🛠 Why Self-Host?
The modern web is built on recurring revenue. We’ve traded ownership for "convenience," resulting in:
* **Feature Creep:** Paying for updates you didn't ask for.
* **Privacy Erosion:** Your data being the secondary product.
* **Cost Bloat:** A dozen "small" monthly fees that add up to thousands per year.

By utilizing Docker Compose, we can deploy enterprise-grade alternatives to the big-name subscriptions—**Jellyfin** instead of Netflix, **Nextcloud** instead of Google Drive, and **n8n** instead of Zapier.

### 👨‍💻 Behind the Lab
I am a **Business Analyst** and **Project Manager** by trade, with a focus on BABOK and PMBOK methodologies. My professional life is spent optimizing processes and managing complex systems for others; my personal life is spent doing the same for my "IKE" home lab.

I’ve transitioned from managing corporate stacks to mastering the homelab, blending professional-grade documentation and logic with the creative freedom of open-source technology. This repository is the intersection of that experience.

### 📦 What's Inside?
This repo contains production-ready `docker-compose.yml` stacks and configurations used in my own environment, including:
* **The "Arr" Stack:** Automated media management.
* **Authentik:** Centralized identity and access management.
* **n8n:** Powerful workflow automation.
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for system health.
