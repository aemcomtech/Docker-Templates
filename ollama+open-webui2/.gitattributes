# PURPOSE: Normalize line endings for a Windows-hosted Docker environment
#          to ensure cross-platform compatibility between "IKE" (Windows) 
#          and Linux-based container services.
# ==============================================================================

# 🎩 MadHatter Summary:
# ---------------------
# - The Architect (White Hat): Standardizes the foundation; prevents the "it works on my 
#   machine" syndrome by enforcing consistent line-ending logic across the stack.
# - The SysAdmin (Green Hat): A critical patch for the "CRLF vs LF" headache. Ensures 
#   your .sh scripts and .yml configs don't throw invisible syntax errors in Docker.
# - The Student (Blue Hat): A textbook example of Git's power to manage environment 
#   impedance mismatch. Essential for anyone bridging the Windows-Linux divide.
# - The Saboteur (Red Hat): Silences the most common "invisible" bug that breaks 
#   container entrypoints and automation workflows.

# Handle line endings automatically for text files
* text=auto

# Force LF for shell scripts and docker-specific files 
# (Critical for scripts running inside Linux containers)

*.bash text eol=lf

# Ensure web and config files use LF to avoid parsing issues in Linux
*.js text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.php text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.conf text eol=lf

# Force CRLF for Windows-specific batch/PowerShell files
